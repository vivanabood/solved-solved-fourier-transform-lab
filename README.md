<p class="ui header product-top-header" title="Fourier Transform Lab Solution">This week’s lab is based on the application of Fourier analysis of an RL circuit inMultisim.Construct Figure 18.44 in Multisim with Vi(t) set to the pulse train as below. 1. Run simulation to perform Fourier and Transient Analysis to measure theoutput voltage ‘Vc (t)’.a. Record the voltage ‘Vc (t)’ and the current ‘I’ through the capacitorin the table below.b. Take the screen capture for the measurements for ‘Vc (t)’ and linespectrum from Fourier analysis.2. Add 5% tolerances to resistor and inductor and repeat step 3.Measured ‘Vc (t)’ Measured current ‘I’ Without Tolerances With Tolerances3. Answer the following questions:a. Explain the effect of tolerance on output voltage ‘Vc (t)’.b. Identify the frequencies and trace the frequency spectrum for thevoltage ‘Vc (t)’.c. How does tolerance effect the frequencies in the spectrum and theoutput voltage? Explain with the help of measurement results andscreenshots.
